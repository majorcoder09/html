    <h1>Why American History should be taught in Middle schools</h1><br>
    <h3>Life is divided into three terms - that which was, which is, and which will be. Let us learn from the past to profit by the present, and from the present, to live better in the future.<br>

  <h4>The problem</h4>
  <p1>Did you know that it is a requirment in 31 states to teach a child American History to graduate, yet those other states and even more so in middle schools, American History is not only not required, but it is not taught at all.<p1> In the states that have schools that teach American history,people are taught a very minimum amount.Some don't even teach past the Revolutionary War!</p1><br>
  <h4>Why it is a problem</h4><p2>If students are not learning about the past,how could they use that information in the future, when it is of upmost importance?<br>
  It was found in a study that only 1 in 3 Americans could pass the citizenship test and that only 26% of Americans could name all three branches of goverment, according to the James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal.</p2><br>
  <h4>What we can change</h4><p3>This is a very easy problem to solve, teach clean, truthful American history from 3rd grade to 12th grade and beyond.</p3><br>
  <p4>To conclude, this is a very bad problem that threatens the US today and it has a very easy fix.</p4><br>
